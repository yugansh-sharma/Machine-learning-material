# Machine-learning-material
This repo contains materials that one would need in order to learn machine learning on your own

Materials here are all openly available on the internet, this repo only helps placing everything useful together in one place.
The material here was used by me(author of this repo) for personal use.

As to why I am making a repo for all this, one to keep track of all the topics i've gone through and also because even though there is an abundance of study material, there is little to no reference on how to approach each topic.

I will list every material as i personally go through it as to when to study and type of background knowledge required to tackle that topic.

As I go on studying machine learning, i will document everything i do in *Documentation.odt* file. I link every reference material i use along the way in the Documentation and also provide the  material in my repo if viable.
